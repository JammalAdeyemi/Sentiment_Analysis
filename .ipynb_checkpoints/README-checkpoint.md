# StockTwits Crypto Sentiment Analysis

The `StockTwits Crypto` dataset is a collection of tweets scraped from the `StockTwits` platform, which is a social network for traders and investors to share insights, ideas, and sentiment on stocks, crypto, and other financial instruments. This dataset focuses specifically on the `crypto` market and contains over `2 million tweets` from `2021` to `2022`.

The dataset includes features such as the `username`, the `tweet content`, the `time` and `date` of the tweet, and any associated `hashtags` or `mentions`. The tweets are labeled as either `bullish`, `bearish`, or `neutral` sentiment by the StockTwits community. The dataset also includes a `confidence score` for each sentiment label.

Researchers can use this dataset to conduct `sentiment analysis` on the crypto market and gain insights into public opinion on specific cryptocurrencies or the market as a whole. The dataset can be processed using `NLP` or `sentiment analysis` techniques to classify the sentiment expressed in each tweet.

**Note:** This dataset is intended for learning and personal portfolio project purposes only and should not be used for trading or investment decisions.
