# Unleashing Social Sentiments: A Twitter Analysis

The use of `Twitter data` for `sentiment analysis` has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the massive volume of data available and the ease with which opinions and sentiment can be expressed on the platform. By analyzing `Twitter data`, researchers can gain insights into public opinion and `sentiment` on a wide range of topics, from politics to consumer products to social issues.

To conduct a Twitter analysis, researchers typically collect a dataset of tweets related to a particular topic or set of topics. This dataset may include features such as the Twitter username, the tweet content, the time and date of the tweet, and any associated metadata such as hashtags or mentions. The dataset can then be processed using `NLP` or `sentiment analysis` techniques to classify the sentiment expressed in each tweet as `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`.

## Folders
We have 3 folders in the projects

1. `Data`: Contains all the datasets used in the project.
2. `Notebooks`: Contains both `Analysis` and `Modelling` notbook.

## Tools and Technologies
The project was implemented using Python and the following libraries:

1. `Python`, `Pandas`, and `Numpy` for data manipulation and analysis.
2. `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.
3. `Scikit-learn` libraries for training, and evaluating traditional techniques
4. `Tensorflow` library
